                            <p>March 29, 2020</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>So when I tell people that I don’t want to be a software engineer for the long haul 
                            (however, I do enjoy working at my current job a lot right now!), then their natural follow-up 
                            is: what DO you want to do then? </p>
        
                        <p>And my answer is always: I would like to be a food entrepreneur. In what capacity I don’t know yet— 
                            but I can see myself being a cafe owner (Tatte, I’m coming for you), founder of a consumer packaged 
                            goods startup, designer for a snack brand, or venture capitalist for a food-focused fund. </p>

                        <p>However, I have little to show for why I should be an innovator in the food industry other than 
                            a failed attempt at commercializing an algae snack bar and a disastrous summer experience
                             at a BBQ startup, both qualifying more as caricatures of my air-headed college self than actual 
                             work experience. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence I am writing this series, which I am calling "Food!”, that will cover my thoughts on the 
                            consumer food industry. </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>So yeah, you’re thinking “Food!"— what a laaaame name. But here were the other candidates 
                            (and my annotations), and you tell me if any of them are better. (They’re not.)</p>
                       <p><b>Alternate titles for this series:</b></p>
                       <ul>
                           <li>Gastromonica— lol cringe, and I also don’t intend to talk about gastronomy</li>
                           <li>Food Pioneers— love this topic, but what if I want to talk about food dinosaurs?</li>
                           <li>DOOF— a nod to Erewhon, a super upscale Los Angeles-only grocer, but doesn’t have quite the  same ring</li>
                           <li>The Barcode— a neat idea since this series will be primarily devoted to things that can 
                               be scanned and purchased at grocery stores, but this name would be better if I were solely 
                               analyzing the beverage industry</li>
                           <li>The Supermarket Stroll/ In My Basket/ The Checkout Line/ The Aisle Analysis—  
                               um, this is not a mommy blog. </li>
                           <li>The Zhuzh— fun word, that’s all</li>

                       </ul>
