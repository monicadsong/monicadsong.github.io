<title>Deploying my Web Application on an AWS EC2 instance</title>

<h2>How to Run your Web Application on the AWS cloud</h2>
<p>This is how I was able to launch my HBC Tech Scheduler on an AWS Ubuntu Instance in order to use Amazon's free server-side resources.</p>
<hr>

<h4>Creating your Instance</h4>
<p>First, make you sure you have an AWS account, logged in as the root user with free trial privileges.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select Amazon Machine Image type. My computer runs on Ubuntu, so I chose the 64-bit Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type.</li>
	<li>Choose the t2.micro free-tier eligible instance.</li>
	<li>Allow default instance details, storage volume, and tags.</li>
	<li>Configure security group: Add a custom TCP rule which specifies a port range that includes the port number your app uses on your localhost. Also make sure to have an SSH rule to allow inbound traffic on TCP port 22.

	<li>Review and launch.</li>
	<li>Select or create new SSH key pair.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Connecting to your Instance</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go into the directory containing the SSH .pem file.</li>
	<li>Make sure the permission of the file is correct</li>
	<li>Use the SSH command to connect to your instance. Open up the Connect window, where you can copy and paste Amazon's automatically generated SSH command.

	</li>
</ol>

<h4>Launching the App</h4>
<p>Once your inside your instance, 
<ol>
	<li>Git clone your repository</li>
	<li>Install all your packages.</li>
	<li>Run the program. In order to leave the programming running even after disconnecting from the instance, type: <code>nohup python main.py &</code>. Also, make sure to always keep the instance running.
</ol>
Now, your web app will be running at the public IP address and specified port number!
