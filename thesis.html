        <h3>0: Introduction</h3>
        <div class="progress">
          <div class="progress-bar bg-success" role="progressbar" style="width: 10%" aria-valuenow="10" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"></div>
        </div>

        <p>I feel like much of the effort I've spent on this project will not be evident in the final product. 
          So, this webpage here is meant to document my own progress and thought process as well as provide interested visitors a step-by-step 
          guide of how I pursued this idea. Additionally, I'll write down some common mistakes I made, how-to's, etc. 
          that I think will be helpful for my future self and others.  
        </p> 
        <p>
          Also, I should say that this work is by my no means groundbreaking or original. My goal is to demonstrate a systematic
          process for applying machine learning to industry problems, geared towards people who do not have an affinity for math, statistics,
          or CS. I hope to demonstrate solid results in a truly beautiful way. 
        </p>
        <h3>1: The Data</h3>
        <div class="progress">
            <div class="progress-bar bg-success" role="progressbar" style="width: 20%" aria-valuenow="20" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"></div>
          </div>

        <p>The dataset is a corpus of around 350 videos scraped from Youtube -- all filmed from a car dashcam. Here are some example videos:
        </p>

        <p>Each video is eight seconds along, resulting in 240 frames per video when extracted at 30 fps.</p>
        <p>Accompanying each video is a set of annotations:</p>
        <ul> 
          <li>Incident Start Time</li>
          <li>Incident Cue</li>
          <li>Event Start Time</li>
          <li>Event Critical Time</li>
          <li>Human Reaction Time</li>
          <li>Human Response</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I was very lucky in that I got to work with a dataset with a lot of human-related annotations, which
          lends itself to many interesting questions about the differences between human cognition and computer vision.
          However, as of now, only one annotation really matters-- which is the <b>incident cue</b>.
        </p>
        <p>I want to acknowledge some limitations about this dataset:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Size:</b> For machine learning, 252 examples is very small. However, for statistical analysis, 252 videos is a lot.
              So I would say that concerns over the size of the dataset depends on your field. But, I do CS-- so this is definitely
              a tiny dataset. 
            </li> 
            <li><b>Number of sensors (sources of data):</b> This dataset is simple; it only consists of video footage. For developing 
              autonomous vehicle systems, typically people have access to a lot of features in the data-- such as GPS location, weather,
              LIDAR data (proximity of other objects), time of day, velocity of vehicle, etc. Thus, the amount of information 
              that the model receives is severely limited, presenting an interesting opportunity to apply machine learning to in information-scarce 
              settings, which humans are quite good at operating in!  
            </li>


          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The data was collected and annotated by Benjamin Wolfe and Ruth Rosenholtz. </p>

        <h3>2: Baseline Model</h3>
        <div class="progress">
            <div class="progress-bar bg-success" role="progressbar" style="width: 30%" aria-valuenow="30" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"></div>
          </div>
        <p> For this model, I only used videos containing an incident (252 total). I split the data so that:
          <ul>
            <li>60% train videos, 20% validation videos, 20% test videos</li>
            <li>each video would have the same number of negative and positive-labeled frames, resulting in a
              completely balanced dataset</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p> The model is very simple: </p>


        <p> Here I do something quite interesting: and then it is </p>
        <p>This baseline model had . Furthermore, it did a good job of localizing of the incident in these cam videos

          Now the question I want to answer: is how fancy can I get with without recurrency and must incorporate statistical
          techniques to these independent frame-wise scores to get some sense of time and motion? 
        </p> 
        <h3>3: Data Analysis Part I</h3>
        <div class="progress">
            <div class="progress-bar bg-success" role="progressbar" style="width: 40%" aria-valuenow="40" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"></div>
          </div>
        <p> So, it is quite evident that this data is a time series and even exhibits trends. Now, I haven't really
          studied time series analysis that much (i.e. didn't take the course Stat131 here at Harvard), only read up on it 
        </p>

        <p> Some statistical techniques: smoothing (Gaussian, interframe agreement, along with some conditional probability, applying a Kalman Filter
