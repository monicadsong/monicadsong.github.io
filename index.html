                          <h3>Automatic Tech Week Scheduler</h3>

                          <p>This project originated out of a personal need to automatic the tech week scheduling process as tech producer of the Harvard Ballet Company.</p>

                          <h5>Algorithm</h5>

                          <p>During fall semester of my junior year in college, I was tasked with the responsiblity of creating a weeklong rehearsal schedule that could accommodate the busy schedules of 20+ college students. I sat at my desk, writing up several drafts of the schedule and thinking how easily this task lent itself to being automated by a computer program.</p>

                          <p>So for my CS182 final project, I decided to implement an algorithm that could produce the optimal tech week schedule automatically. You can read the full writeup <a href = "https://github.com/monicadsong/CS182-Final-Project/blob/master/CS182_Final_Project_Writeup%20(2).pdf"  target="_blank">here</a>. But pretty much, I formulated the problem as constraint scheduling problem and solved it using several different algorithms including heuristic-based depth-first search and simulated annealing.</p>

                          <h5>Web Application</h5>

                          <p>I knew I wanted other people (i.e. future tech producers) to use my program, so I created a web interface using Flask. Dancers can log in and input their availability for the week. Then, once all the information has been collected, tech producers can create a schedule with the simple click of a button.</p>

                          <p> I also experimented with Amazon Web Services as a platform to host my web application for free. I <a href = "http://blog.monicasong.com/AWS-instance/" target = "_blank">transferred it to an Elastic Cloud instance</a>, where it can be accessed at IP address: http://34.207.173.18:5001.</p>

                        <h3>Parallelizing Matrix Factorization</h3>

                          <p>For my data science course, a group of 2 students and I completed a project involving restaurant recommendations involving <a href = "https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge">Yelp's academic dataset</a>.</p>

                          <p>In order to predict user ratings, we followed the Alternating Least Squares method detailed in <a href = 
                            "https://datajobs.com/data-science-repo/Recommender-Systems-[Netflix].pdf" target = "_blank">this popular paper</a> from 2009. We implemented the algorithm from scratch.</p>

                          <p>However, we stumbled across several problems when running our code:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Training the model took <i>waaaaay</i> too long. (Like 3 days... and we still were only halfway through our iterations)</li>
                              <li>The data set was too large</li>
                            </ul>
                          </p>

                          <p>So when it finally came down to submitting our project, we were only able to submit a model that was training on a very small (3000 data points) data set. Additionally, becuase our training data was so limited, our model was vastly overfitted and had a terrible accuracy rate of only around 30% on the test set.</p>

                          <p>Later, when I had more time, I decided I wanted to revisit this project. First, I optimized our data set by saving it as a HDF5 file to mitigate I/O problems.</p>

                          <p>I also worked to parallelize the training of the model. The paper itself stated that parallelizing the algorithm would be incredibly simple. <blockquote>In ALS, the system computes each q<sub>i</sub> independently of the other item factors and computes each p<sub>u</sub> independently of the other user factors. This gives rise to potentially massive parallelization of the algorithm. </blockquote> Upon doing more research, I found that it was indeed <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">"embarassingly easy"</a> to do. The process was also detailed in <a href = "http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.173.2797&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target = "_blank">this paper</a>.</p>

                          <p>Using Python's multiprocessing functionality, I was able to parallelize the computation by splitting the calculation of the inner product vectors for each user or item into 4 different processes. Coding-wise, this was extremely straightforward to do using the "pool" object in the multiprocessing module. Once I finished the program, I ran it on my own machine, and was able to achieve a accuracy rate of 80%.</p>

                          <p>Code can be found <a href = "https://github.com/monicadsong/matrix_factorization_mp" target="_blank">here</a>. Note: this is still a current work in progress</p>

                  <h4>Why Me?</h4>
                  <p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
                  <p>I know that I may not have the best resume or highest GPA. However, what sets me apart is my desire to learn as much as I can. I am willing to put in the hard work, extra hours, and additional resources to make the most out of my educational and professional experiences. I’ve completed several personal projects in my free time: an automatic scheduler to help me with my Harvard Ballet Company responsibilities and another to help optimize the run time of my data science course final project (post submitting it).  I truly enjoy my CS courses, as grueling as they can be. My data science, computational theory, and AI courses last semester have been an especially eye-opening experience, and I have grown to truly love the material that I am learning. I look forward to my junior spring semester where I’ll be diving deep into my statistics, algorithms, and machine learning course work.</p>
                  <p>After two and half years in college, I’ve learned several important lessons, one of them being the value of hard work. I believe the most valuable thing I have to offer to you is my drive to work hard. I also am well-practiced in the art of recovering from failure and am always looking for opportunities to redeem myself from past missteps. </p>
                  <p>Last summer, I interned as a product designer and marketing intern at a smart home startup. While I gained valuable design and communication skills, I soon realized that this was not the career for myself. I would like to transition into more engineering- and code-heavy roles, since I envision myself ten years from now working in either data or AI/ML. And now more than ever, I am eager to expand my knowledge and to continue my educational experience outside of my college campus. </p>

                        <p><b>Background:</b> Datamatch is a semi-satirical Valentine's Day matchmaking service used by over half of Harvard's student body. Students take a quiz and then receive a list of their ten most compatible matches based on our algorithm.</p>
      
                        <p><b>Process</b>:
                        <i>How can you improve an already functional and visually appealing product?</i> <br>I remember as a freshman, when I first took the quiz, I wanted to know who built the website because I thought it was so cool, but I couldn't find the information I was looking for. So after joining the team in 2016, when our project lead asked us for ways to improve the fifteen-year-old service, I knew what to say. I pitched the idea of a credits page to him, and he immediately took a liking. I mocked it up, first on a whiteboard and later on Photoshop using my favorite family of course-- the Kardashians. I then helped implement it on the website, modifying the HTML and SASS files of our homepage.

By coming up with this feature, I helped popularize the idea of joining the Datamatch development team among our student body.</p>
                        <p><b>Other Assets:</b> I also designed social media posts, stickers, flyers, and posters for our publicity campaign. </p>

                        <p><b>Process:</b> <i>How do you build a brand?</i><br>When I was first approached to work on this project, the packaging of the bars was already designed:

                        </figure>
                         and I was responsible for creating the rest of the startup's brand identity. With this image serving as inspiration, I designed a suite of assets riffing off its fonts, colors, and styles.</p>
                       
                        <p><b>Impact:</b><br> I helped craft the visual identity of Rooted. I incorporated elements of the packaging design, such as the type overlay and brown paper motif, into our posters, website images and graphics, second flavor packaging, and complete investor pitch deck. I created a cohesive brand image that conveyed Rooted's values of sustainability and innovation.</p>

                        <p><b>Process: </b><i>How do you create value for consumers?</i><br>
                        It's a challenge that many startups face: offering value to consumers without yet having a physical product. Taking insights from marketing, customer behavior, and business strategy, I concluded that we needed to focus on <i>content marketing</i>, i.e. creating and offering the best content possible to the consumer. As an intern, I also wanted to use my skills to make the biggest impact I could during the summer. My solution was to develop a long-form piece of content that would convey Desora's engineering expertise, its distinguishing factor among competitors. Here is a selection of the lab report:

                              <p>Solution: Recognizing that couples tend to overspend on their weddings, my project partner and I created Engagemint, an online wedding planner and registry that encourages newly engaged couples to budget cost-effectively. Engagemint recommends couples a wedding budget and provides low-cost party-planning options to help them meet their budget. Furthermore, after the wedding, couples have the option to exchange unwanted gifts for cash. Engagemint effectively solves the problem of overspending by encouraging users to invest in their marriage, literally and figuratively! </p>

                              <p>Solution: Elocutio is a web platform designed to improve the user's communication skills. With the slogan “Say ‘Hello’ to Elo!” Elocutio’s main functionality is its advanced artificial intelligence bot, aptly named Elo, which can engage the user in casual and formal conversation as well as provide valuable feedback to improve the user’s performance.</p>

                              <p>In order to combat the huge user attrition rates that online learning platforms suffer from, Elocutio can be synced up with one's mobile calendars, so Elo nudges users to practice with it before an important meeting or presentation. Elocutio can also be integrated with voice-activated devices; the user simply needs to say "Hello Elo!" in order to activate Elocutio in his or her home. </p>

In our research, we found that the students were most interested in seeing grade distributions. and many of them often looked at hundreds of courses when selecting their courses for the semester.</p>

                              <p>Given the sheer volume of classes to browse through (and the clicks and page loads that would require), we decided to create the R-Guide, which is essentially Tinder for classes. On the R-Guide, users can swipe through courses quickly and save them in their CourseCart. Another important feature is our user-generated grade distributions, based on anonymously submitted grades from our user base.</p>

                              </p>My project group decided to focus on the trend of DIY, specifically looking back to the era of mixtapes. The mixtape was a wonderful gift to give to your friends, encapsulating the hours you spent in creating that personal playlist, which the giftee could tangibly appreciate through both the physical mixtape and the playlist itself. So we created ReMix, a headphone and app duo that recalls the DIY mixtape culture of past years while refreshing the process for the modern era and the maker movement.</p>
