                        <p>All my life my mom and dad have always told me that I am incredibly lucky. 
                            And I guess it's true, I am most fortunate. During this wild weird time, I have once 
                            again blessed with many things that give me a sense of normalcy and meaning.</p>
                            <hr>
                        <p><i>I didn't include a lot of items in this list because a) I felt like either
                            they were too basic (like having hand soap and getting satisfaction from doing household chores) or 
                            b) I am probably too privileged to recognize as being part of my good fortune. But anyway, here we go:</i></p>

                        <p>a great work-from-home set up (love my L-shaped desk especially), a Twitter feed that makes me laugh and cry at the same time, an evening glass of red wine,
                            being a natural introvert (or maybe recluse is a better word given
                            how quickly i adjusted??), 
                            candles that keep my room smelling nice,
                            finding good music on Spotify, 
                            graduating in 2019, group texts with my gals, 
                            hiking trails with wildflowers,
                            joggers that are comfy but still look like work pants (i know i know, who even cares what you wear anymore),
                            living in a really nice and spacious apartment (great water pressure, in-unit laundry, amazing bathroom lighting lol, etc.), long and slow runs, 
                            my job and feeling like my work is important (!!), my Manduka yoga mat, my pink Hoka’s (these are without a doubt the most stylish shoes I own), 
                            parents who are strong and healthy and who can take care of themselves, perfect weather for marathon training,
                            physical books and the San Carlos public library, 
                            residing in the suburbs where the sidewalks are wide and living pace slow, 
                            spontaneous video chats, 
                            the ice maker in my fridge (iced water? iced coffee? iced orange juice? iced almond milk? yes, yes, yes, and yes.), Trader Joe’s (x10),
                            writers/artists/vloggers that are producing killer content in the midst of all this craziness
                            </p>
