                        <h4>Things I like that you should too</h4>
                        <p><i>Maybe you like these things already, and if you don’t, give them a try!</i></p>

                        <p><b>Animated Movies</b>: Animated movies are often overlooked, but they tend to have the most compelling and unique 
                        storylines in my opinion. I recently watched <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallfoot_(film)" target
                        ="_blank">Smallfoot</a>, and it was surprisingly good. While it is easy to draw parallels between 
                        Smallfoot’s plot and today’s state of science and religion, a more nuanced take would be to interpret the movie as a 
                        warning against groupthink in general</p> 
                        <p><b>The Chef Show</b>: My go-to recommendation on Netflix when anyone asks. In 
                        addition to the cooking scenes (the grilled cheese! the blender marinades! the oysters!), 
                        the conversation between Roy and Jon is fun and quippy too.  And after watching that episode 
                        with movie director Robert Rodriguez (S1E5), I’m convinced my future house needs a wood-fired
                        pizza oven so I can host the greatest dinner parties ever. </p>
                        <p><b>Going to the public library</b>: I have been a long time supporter of public libraries 
                            and always have around 2-4 books checked out. I like having physical books with me, especially 
                            for when I’m commuting to work or on the Caltrain (gotta save that phone battery!). </p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker-Bitterness/dp/B0047BIWSK" target="_blank"><b>AeroPress</b></a>: This little grey plastic coffee maker, though it may not have 
                            the aesthetic graces of a pour-over set, is so functional that it deserves its own permanent 
                            piece of real estate on the kitchen counter. Perfect for making a single 10 oz cup of 
                            very strong coffee. </p>


                        <h4>Things I try really hard to like</h4>
                        <p><b>Yoga</b>: So I bought a Manduka black pro yoga mat (they're quite expensive!) in order 
                            to motivate myself to commit to a daily yoga practice-- it’s worked, kinda. 
                            I managed to complete <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBu-pQG6sTY"
                            target="_blank">30 Days of Yoga with Adrienne</a>. I have to be in the mood to do it,
                             but there are certain days when I 
                            really know that a 20-minute flow will start my day off right.</p>
                        <p><b>Headspace</b>: I recently took the course on sleeping on Headspace, but 
                        I don’t know if I actually meditated or have just closed my eyes for ten minutes. </p>
                        <p><b>Tweeting</b>: Tweeting. is. so. hard. I don’t know how people can be clever 
                        in 140 character snippets. <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen"
                        target="_blank">Chrissy Teigen</a>, teach me your ways! </p>
                        <p>Monthly resolutions: I love the idea of committing to a new goal at the start of
                        a month, but it’s never fully worked for me. Failed resolutions include: take a cold 
                        shower every day, cook every day, stop biting my nails, read every day. </p>

                        <h4>Things I like that everyone else does too</h4>
                        <p><b>Hydroflasks</b>: I had my vsco girl moment loooong before it was a thing. 
                            I carry with me everywhere a turquoise 20 oz bottle from nearly 4 years ago that’s covered with 
                            stickers from college clubs and activities. </p>
                        <p><b>Thrift Shopping</b>: One of the redeeming things about living in my town is the 
                            thrift store. It’s called Thrift Shopping Thrift Center, very descriptive I know. 
                            I’ve gotten a couple of tops and jackets there, my halloween costume, serving bowls
                            that I used at my housewarming, the artwork hanging above my bed. You have to do a
                            little bit of digging to find the good stuff, but it’s a a gem.</p>
                        <p><b>AirPods</b>: I am on my second pair of AirPods. I actually lost my first pair 
                            within a week of getting them and Amazon Primed myself another set within 3
                            0 minutes. So extra, but so necessary.</p>
                        <p><b>Sunday Riley</b>: The Internet loves Sunday Riley, so I do too. 
                            Anthropologie occasionally has 30% off everything sales, so that’s
                            when I stock up (the <a href="https://sundayriley.com/products/luna-sleeping-night-oil"
                            target="_blank">Luna Night Oil</a> is my holy grail!). But alert for 
                            all the Sunday Riley fans out there: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/us/sunday-riley-fake-reviews-trnd/index.html"
                            target="_blank">the company was recently caught writing 
                            fake reviews on Sephora</a>— so maybe it’s all just a sham!!</p>

                        <h4>Things I like that no one else does (or very few people do)</h4>
                        <p><b>Cruciferous Vegetables</b>: Cabbage is one of my favorite vegetables. It’s 
                        so cheap (only 99 cents a pound, even at Whole Foods), super easy to stir fry, 
                        and filling. Brussels sprouts are also up there— not as homely as cabbage, but 
                        they’re also around 4 times more expensive by weight.  You can cook them sliced 
                        with some bacon and parmesan and drizzle on some syrupy balsamic… so. friggin. good.</p>
                        <p><b>Making weekly Spotify playlists</b>: I’ve kept a catalog of the songs I've listened to ever since 2015.
                            It’s quite nostalgic to look back at these small playlists from time to time and see how
                            my preferences have evolved.</p>
                        <p><b>Tretorn Shoes</b>: I have spent a good amount of time looking for the perfect white sneaker, 
                            and my answer: <a href="https://us.tretorn.com/store/nylite-bold-women.html" target="_blank">
                            Tretorn Nylite 3 Bold's</a>. They’re not as mainstream as the Adidas Gazelles 
                            or Nike Air Force 1's, not as elementary as Supergas, and not as expensive as Vejas. 
                            These sneakers are so comfortable due to the lip around the heel. Plus they have a kitschy vibe, 
                            popularized in the 1960s by tennis great Bjorn Borg. Other brands that have caught my eye 
                            include <a href="https://karhu.com/usa/" target="_blank">Karhu</a> and 
                            <a href="https://us.arkkcopenhagen.com/" target="_blank">ARKK Copenhagen</a>. The Scandinavians make great sneakers, man.</p>

                        <h4>Things I like that I probably shouldn’t</h4>
                        <p><b>Love Island UK</b>: I live for this show. Not gonna lie, watching an episode every
                        day was one of the highlights my summer 2019. The contestants are all so good-looking,
                        the drama top-notch, the “banter” hilarious. 10/10. Also, addendum: Love Island Australia
                        is not bad (but let’s not talk about the US version…)</p>
                        <p><b>Pretty Basic Podcast</b>: Another innocuous vice. Just two girls talking about
                        their Hinge dates, Youtube/ social media influencer careers, and 
                        "discovering personal growth”.</p>
                        <p><b>Personality tests</b>: On one hand, they seem so insightful.  But on the 
                        other hand, they are very much a self-fulfilling prophecy. Like yes, I am an INTJ — 
                        tell me how unique and good at problem-solving I am! Even though they’re just 
                        <a href="https://qz.com/emails/quartz-obsession/1777253/" target="_blank">a load of pseudoscience</a>, 
                        they’re still a fun way to “get to know yourself better” (lol).</p>
