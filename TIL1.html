                            <p> Animated movies: Animated movies are often overlooked, but they tend to have the most compelling and unique storylines 
                                in my opinion. I recently watched Smallfoot (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBw6EvIxIS8" target="_blank">trailer</a>) on a plane, and it was super good! while it is easy to draw parallels between 
                                Smallfoot’s plot and today’s state of science and religion, I guess a more nuanced take would be to interpret the movie as a 
                                warning about groupthink in general. </p>
                            <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81028317 " target="_blank">The Chef Show</a>: One of my favorite shows on Netflix. In addition to the cooking scenes (the grilled cheese! the blender marinades! 
                                the oysters!), the conversation between Roy and Jon is really fun too.</p>
                            <p><a href="https://patternbrands.com/" target="_blank">Pattern Brands</a>: I’m a glutton for mindfulness, so this seems right up my alley.  I don’t know if I’ll ever buy their products,
                                 but their website is super cute. I'm a fan of their <a href="https://patternbrands.com/our-guide" target="_blank">guide</a> and 
                                 <a href="https://patternbrands.com/our-library" target="_blank">library</a>. </p>
                            <p><a href="http://www.madewithmotif.com/" target="_blank">Motif Foods</a>: I remember stumbling upon Motif Foods while I was job searching. It seems like they have done a rebrand recently 
                                and become more corporate, but I’m bookmarking this company to keep an eye on them for any future updates. When it comes to food 
                                innovation, most of the companies I hear about are direct-to-consumer (<a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/" target="_blank">Impossible Foods,</a> 
                                <a href = "https://www.ripplefoods.com/" target="_blank">Ripple Foods</a>, <a href="https://seedlipdrinks.com/us" target="_blank">Seedlip</a>),
                                 so I always forget that there’s an entire space of B2B companies in the food innovation industry.</p>
                            <p><a href= "https://joinzoe.com/" target="_blank">ZOE</a>: This startup impressed me because of its claims of using “science” to help you eat better, which seem to be well-supported.  
                                I’ve always been into the health and wellness industry, and I have seen the proliferation of pseudoscience-y wellness products 
                                (e.g. <a href="https://us.foursigmatic.com/" target="_blank">mushroom coffee</a>, <a href="https://shop.bulletproof.com/" target="_blank">butter coffee</a>, <a href="https://mudwtr.com/" target="_blank">mud coffee</a>?) 
                                so it’s cool to see a company base their product <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/health/nutrition-diet-genetics-food.html" target="_blank">on so much scientific research</a>. </p>
                            <p><a href="http://www.papachay.com/" target="_blank">Papachay Coffee</a>: Speaking of coffee, my favorite thing about San Carlos is Papachay, a small shop that sources their 
                                beans directly from the owners’ farm in Peru. I’m no coffee expert, so I can’t say if their beans are truly special, but I 
                                definitely feel special when I use their coffee. </p>
